This is my first entry into my value documentation repo.

# Adding more value

There is an inherent constraint in the value that we add as people, we overestimate. We overestimate our value in people’s lives, in business and as we go through life we expect more because we give more. We don’t expect that the value that we are adding could not be aligned with company values, not be aligned from a company or personal perspective.

Here are ways of adding value correctly:

- Improve processes and efficiencies
- Reduce the work load on your boss
- Reduce stress and workloads of others
- Be uplifting in the office
- Document the value you add.

Here are ways that I currently add value:

- I am a mentor to a junior developer
- I am building out features in a more maintainable way
- I am rebuilding the front end
- I communicate with the BA to streamline feature development
- I communicate with QA to make sure delivered features are up to standards

I an attempt to be more strategic with the way that I use my time I need te keep myself from spending time on things that don't add value. Ways of keeping track will be this markdown journal.
