## the day of reckoning

I have done some amazing things this past week. For years and years I have been wondering if I will ever get back my passion for software and finding the best solutions. For the past couple of week I have researching ways of building effective PDF generation in an angular frontend. I was unsuccessful in finding a way, but I have gotten a backend solution running. We are now generating PDF documents quicker than before, pagination and compressions are running smoothly.

The project is still far from stable, my fellow colleagues are demotivated. They are tired, exhausted and do not wish to continue, I fear that some of them want to quit. Working for a software startup is not easy. You must have the ability to adapt, to work under pressure and keep true to the main goal

## strategic thinking.

I would love to say that I am better at strategic thinking since my last entry. I fear that I may have gotten worse, but it is a process. Learning and growing has been fun but I don't really think I'm getting the hang of this.
