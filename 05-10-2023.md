## Energy

We always want to add energy to everything. We think that effort will solve the inherit problem of not getting enough done. That is not the case, we need to find a better way of dealing with the stresses of work and life.

## Stage 1 - Consumption vs Production

In a nut shell how much are you adding towards your life vs how much are you taking.

Building a life without having the ability to produce more than you take out of life is the issue with our "batteries" being flat.

I don't support the idea of living only for vacations and leave days. The idea of only having two weeks per year where you actually live is idiotic.

## Stage 2 - Building a life of significance

The concept of giving a SHIT

You do everything like you do everything.

## Stage 3 - Giving back more

Live a life of giving back emotionally
